							<h3 class="iconbox-title">from H</h3>
							In late 2017, Jenn and I were both (separately) moving to the Bay Area to start our new jobs. We found each other through a dating app and connected over our shared interest for the outdoors and connection to the Pacific Northwest (my childhood home). We decided to meet up over coffee + hike on a breezy January day. While the view was less than spectacular that day due to cloudy conditions, I was able to learn so much about her, including the fact that she can hike faster than me! I loved how caring and down-to-earth she was and love the fact that I could make her laugh with my corny jokes. After a few more dates we made it official. Jenn and I have created lots of memories with each other over the past three years and we can't wait to make much more, as husband and wife.

							<h3 class="iconbox-title">from J</h3>
							I was working in Sacramento at the time right after grad school and had set my Coffee Meets Bagel app location to SF since I had just accepted a new job offer back in the Bay. I had tapped no to everyone that had popped up -- until one day on my lunch break Hien’s profile showed up and I thought oh no.. he actually looks like a nice guy and I can’t think of any excuses to tap no. So I left it for a full 24 hours and after lots of encouragement from my coworkers, went back and double tapped the heart by his name. We exchanged numbers and planned to meet up after the new year. Weeks went by, so when he texted me again I thought oh gosh he remembered and this is actually happening! He was my first and last date through the app. That first date turned into a coffee + two hikes + late lunch adventure over 7 hours long. A few days later, he surprised me on a Thursday winter night with a trip to the ice cream shop by my place. That night at Twin Peaks he gave me a hug, and I secretly took a photo of him from behind because I had a feeling that moment was something special I would want a memory of. Within two weeks, we had planned our first snowboarding trip to Tahoe and booked our first campsite at Yosemite. From then on he has become my very best friend on this adventure of a lifetime.

						We have dreamt up a plan that allows us to be married in the company of those we love, while keeping our guests comfortable and safe. We understand that everyone joining will be experiencing different levels of comfort in the presence of others and we intend to follow social distancing guidelines on our wedding day, regardless of any reopening changes that might be in effect. The health of our community is a top priority, even if it means postponing hugs until a later date.
						<br>
						<br>
						Our venue is well-informed about social distancing measures and gathering restrictions that are part of Oregon COVID compliance for gatherings. Currently, they will not seat more than 10 people (of the same exposure group) at each table, and tables must be spaced 6 feet apart. Weddings are required to have two cleaners and one social distance monitor per 50 guests.
						<br>
						<br>
						We will get in touch to ask you about your desired seating arrangements after your RSVP.

						Pets are not allowed.
						<br>

						Please kindly adhere to the above rules to help us avoid being charged penalty fees!
